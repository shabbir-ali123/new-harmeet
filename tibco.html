          <h3>TIBCO - Manager</h3>
          <p>
            Business Connect is an on-premise enterprise B2B platform that
            facilitates secure communication and transfer of messages and
            documents between different business partners and a central host.
            The application, initially built over 20 years ago, was in dire need
            of modernization to keep up with current technological standards and
            user expectations. I initiated this project alongside a team member
            and, after establishing a solid foundation, transitioned the project
            to my team in India for further development. My involvement spanned
            end-to-end across various phases, working closely with stakeholders,
            UX researchers, developers, and QA teams.
